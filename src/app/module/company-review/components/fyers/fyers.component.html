                    Thematic (pronounced as THe'madik) Investment is about "investing in ideas" (i.e. group of stocks related to the idea) instead of choosing individual stocks. Fyers offers 100's of predefined themes (or portfolios) which customer can choose from to invest in stock market. Each theme has set of stocks which relates to the idea.

The closest comparison of thematic investment is Exchange Traded Funds (ETF's). The thematic investment offers lot more flexibility over etf's as the companies to invest in a theme are identified by the broker, fund-manage or even a group of people in a community.
